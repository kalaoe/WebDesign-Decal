<strong><em>EECS Major ⋅ 1st Year</em></strong>

<p>Hey! I'm Chloe (alternatively spelled kalaoe due to usernames being taken and it 
    generally being the way people pronounce my name in Chinese). I'm a huge fan of 
    both programming and art, hence why I'm here! Talk to me about anything 
    art/design/programming related and I'll be happy to chat!</p>

<p>PS: If you don't recognize me by face (which I get, there's like 40K students on 
    campus and I'm also terrible at facial recognition), remember me by my pink mask 
    :P</p>

        I learned that there's a lot more to design than I had originally given it 
        credit for! While things like clear focal points, color scheme, and 
        accessibility are incredibly important parts of design, even more minute 
        things like wording, organization, and subtle emphasis of information are 
        important to consider.

        I loved how Warner began breaking down the design choices that both Airbnb 
        and Twitter made with specific examples. While I knew that studying
        existing successful apps was important, I was thinking on a much broader 
        scale than what was demonstrated. I was thinking about points of interest, 
        color scheme, and the like, but what I didn't realize was that more subtle 
        things like Airbnb's "Try 'London'" on its search bar could also make a big 
        difference.

        "I wonder how many iterations they tried with Dates and Guests only being 
        visible at a later point in the flow. I’m sure many designs have gone 
        through explorations where the Dates aren’t presented until you select a 
        location. This makes me curious about how people search and when they 
        introduce filters to their searches." - I love how the writer presents what 
        she is thinking when she sees this design choice which I previously 
        wouldn't have given a second thought!

        10/10 - Brief, but one of the most (if not <em>the</em> most) informative 
        articles I've read about web design!
