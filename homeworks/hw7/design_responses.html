					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about emergence from this article. This is the principle that
								people first identify things in their general outlined form. In short,
								simpler objects with stronger shape language are easier to identify
								than those that are more detailed. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite prat of this article was its overall structure. I learned 
								about Gestalt principles previously, but having them presented in this
								way was a great way to organize my thoughts. Each concept was first
								introduced with a more intuitive and approachable example before being
								shown used in a UI context. For instance, I used to have a hard time 
								understanding how continuity applied in UI, although I understood it
								from an appeal perspective. Having the UI example and the explanation
								of how that principle was applied was incredibly insightful to me.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "...visual design and psychology are linked and can influence one another. 
								Gestalt principles can help us understand and control these links." </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 9; a lot of this information was repeated for me, but I still found it 
								informative and loved the visuals.</p>
