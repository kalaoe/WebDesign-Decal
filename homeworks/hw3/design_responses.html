							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
								I learned that not only font sizes, but the ratio between font sizes is an 
								important part of typography. There are resources online that provide ratios 
								that you can use in your own works. Some of these ratios are based on things
								like geometry, music, and nature and include Minor Second (15:16), Perfect 
								Fourth (3:4), and Major Third (4:5).
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
								My favorite part of this article was about font pairing. I've learned to develop
								an eye for what looks decent and what doesn't when it comes to typography, but
								I tend to struggle with pairing. The links to font pairing inspo were fantastic
								and a resource I will definitely take advantage of in the future!

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>
								"...text is one of the primary ways designers can communicate with users. Typography can make or break a design."

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p>
								On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate my enjoyment at about a 9 for this article.
								Some of it was repeat information for me, but I liked the examples that they 
								used to demonstrate the importance of the principles they described and the
								typography resources they provided.
