							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Visual acessibility in web design is more than just making sure colors contrast from each other.
							   There are many more things that can be improved— for instance, using symbols or patterns to
							   highlight important details or make it easier to read data is crucial when it comes to web design.
							   Things like focal state contrast can also help people by allowing them to navigate with motor
							   disabilities or visual impairments.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of this article was the links to Colorable and Colorsafe. I tend to enjoy being
							   given real-world resources and learning how to use them in my own work, so being given these
							   sites and messing around with them was fun! Also, learning about the regulations on visual 
							   accessibility (ie., W3C's guidelines) was interesting, as I hadn't known there were standards for
							   web accessibility before.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"As designers, developers, and general tech people, we have the power to create a web we’re all 
								proud of: an inclusive web made for and consumable by all people."</p>
						</li>
