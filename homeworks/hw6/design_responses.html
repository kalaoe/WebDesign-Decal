					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Duration and speed of animations should be taken into account. Too short, and the 
								animation won't be recognized whatsoever; too long, and the user will be stuck 
								waiting. The optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms, but
								it varies between devices as well. Larger devices, like tablets, should have
								longer animations than smaller ones, like smartwatches, because of the distance
								elements need to travel on each size. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked how they mentioned the importance of easing and when to use linear motion
								(ie., only when the object changes color or transparency; when it's not changing 
								position). This was directly applicable to the animations that we just did, where
								the only usage of linear motion was for changing the color of the rings from the 
								spin loading animation. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Just like in ballet choreography, the main idea is to guide the userâ€™s attention
								in one fluid direction during the transition from one state to another." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I would rate my enjoyment from reading this article at a 10. I may be biased (as I 
								do animation for art), but I enjoyed seeing the artistic principles that I had 
								learned separately come into play in this article and homework. </p>
